Cryss' Greenhouses - A Fallout 4 mod

Description:
Three greenhouses, all navmeshed (DLC required) (small, medium, large) I wanted to use with Horizon with a Winter playtrough. All three have a concret foundation for easier placement on unleveled ground.
I didn't add any decoration so you have plenty of room to let your inner architect run wild!
There havn't been any bug reports so I call this stable.
The Greenhouses can be found in /Prefabs/Warehouses of the workshop menu.
